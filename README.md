# Task-tracker
A simple program to add, store, and manage tasks

This is a project I am using to improve and practice my Python skills as well as use to track my day to day tasks
My goal is to commit once per day, adding something meaningful to the project


Project Spec:
Tasks: Due Date, Name, Description
Functions: Create, update, day at a glance, week at a glance, search, view
View: Next and previous with sorting options

Store tasks in csv file and load to array for viewing, updating, and sorting. Overwrite CSV file after each action
